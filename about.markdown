Click through docs for Open Source edu courses in the realm of creative coding at PCC (and beyond?).

This site uses [jekyll](https://jekyll.org) to generate a website from a directory of documentation files. The installation was very easy on both ubuntu and mac OS. Why generate a website from plain documentation? 

- click thru navigation for browsing and ruminating
- pushable to github pages for public access
- much easier to read than text files
- avoids 'unsavory' applications like word processors and google docs/drive
- publishable to any web server
- compatible with jupyter notebooks!
