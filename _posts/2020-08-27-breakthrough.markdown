So my python script that reads files labelled with start and end times and generates an MLT XML file loads right into Shotcut (an open source video editing program). I did not expect it to work, but, I am very pleased that it does. I have not used Shotcut at all yet, but, I was able to export the project as a video and did not have to edit (in the traditional sense) my video.

There is a lot of work to do, but pretty exciting to get the proof of concept out of the way.
