## Overview
### Course Description
Covers theories and frameworks related to computational or artificial creativity and approaches to endowing machines with creative behaviors. Involves examination of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in connection with a comprehensive range of arts and creative enterprises such as musical composition and interpretation, sound design, video game creation, drawing, painting, image generation, writing, storytelling, poetry, and design-related tasks. Prerequisites: WR 115, RD 115 and MTH 20 or equivalent placement test scores. Recommended: MUC 272.

*RECOMENDATIONS:*
Currently this course is designed to be accessible to non-programmers as more of a survey and introduction to the technologies and possibilities. A level II or III with more prereqs could easily be developed to build out from here.

### Outcomes
- Define artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and key vocabularies of AI/ML to understand and engage in public and academic discourse.
- Recount the technological and social histories of AI/ML, including the technological lineages and surrounding narratives.
- Define computational creativity (artificial creativity or metacreation) and illustrate its historical and contemporary roles with real-world examples in multiple arts (sonic arts, visual arts, literary arts) and from artists of diverse cultural and national identities.
- Demonstrate competence with historical and contemporary AI and ML creative applications, technologies, softwares and/or toolchains.

*This is perhaps the broadest and most complicated outcome to assume for an Open Course with 10 short modules. Especially since the idea of submitted and reviewed assignments is not totally clear to me. Proposing a list of external resources, and a thorough examination of the skills, techniques and tools necessary for continued experimentation in lieu of “demonstration of competence”*

**Additional Outcome Ideas:**
Understanding of several key algorithms and their uses. Mainly markov chains, knn, and various ANNs. These should be very high level and focus on the big ideas of each approach with clear, illustrative examples.

**Notes on Outcomes:**
My current inclination is to make these series of videos informative, welcoming, interesting and. with some luck, exciting. It strikes me that the purpose of these videos is to function almost as an invitation. Whether to enroll in courses at PCC, elsewhere, or continue independent research Open Courses are supportive in nature to the rearrangement of neurons and the changing of one’s world. It is a safe place to be curious and an impartial source (meaning in this sense that it is agnostic of Product) that the viewer might hope has curated something of interest. The means are the ends. The short target length of these videos warrant the content is highly intentional.
